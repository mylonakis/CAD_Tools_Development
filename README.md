- Lab_1: Newton-Raphson method for calculating the roots of a polynomial function.
- Lab_2: A simple on/off simulator for CMOS circuits, using graph coloring technique. Also, recongizes short and open circuit issues.
- Lab_3: Hierarchical design - Dataset generation for our simple CMOS simulator. A circuit of logic gates is provided as input,
         it is translated to the respective CMOS one, and the TTL circuit is simulated at flat level. For converting logic gates to the
         correspoding CMOS circuit, the appropriate library file is available.
- Lab_4: Hierarchical design - Graph Generation, Bipartite Graph Detection and Creation of Two Datasets from One. We utilize the fact that
         the netlist file is a mathematical structure of a directed acyclic graph, in order to generate two sub-circuits from the original.
- Lab_5: Basic Formal Verification methods for searching sub-structures equivelant to logic gates.
- Lab_6: Model Checking and Formal Verification: Isomorphic Graphs. Providing the correct connectivity of a circuit (stored in a file), it is compared
         with the circuit under examination, in order to determine if the two circuits are equivelant. The basic idea is that, since the circuits are
         described in the form of a directed acyclic graph, we search for the maximum subgraph within the circuit (i.e paths from source to destinations)
         and we compare it with the correct one in terms of node coloring.
